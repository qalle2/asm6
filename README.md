# asm6
asm6 (6502 assembler) by loopy. Version 1.6. Source, Windows binary and Linux binary.

I (qalle2) haven't modified the program, just compiled the Linux binary.

## Files
* `asm6.c`, `README.TXT` and `binaries.zip/asm6.exe` were extracted from `asm6.zip`, which was downloaded from [here](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/674/).
* `binaries.zip/asm6` is a 64-bit Linux binary, compiled by me with gcc using the `-O3` argument.
